    "#### Comparing the model's confusion matrix and classification report\n",
    "     1. LOGISTIC REGRESSION :  While it performs decently, it is the least effective compared to the other models, with lower accuracy and performance metrics\n",
    "     \n",
    "     2. DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER : This model shows perfect performance on both the training and testing sets. However, decision trees can often overfit, so further validation is essential.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     3. RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER :The Random Forest Classifier achieves perfect training accuracy and a solid test accuracy. Its precision, recall, and F1-scores are balanced and high, indicating robust performance for both classes\n",
    "     \n",
    "     4. XG BOOST CLASSIFIER : The XGBoost Classifier also shows perfect training accuracy but slightly lower test accuracy than Random Forest. Its precision, recall, and F1-scores are still very good, indicating effective performance, though slightly less robust than Random Forest.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Overall Best Model: Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "     Though Decsion tree normally have an issue of overfitting, we can exclude it by observing the graph.\n",
    "     The Decision Tree Classifier stands out with perfect test accuracy and perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores for both classes, indicating it makes no errors on the test set.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      However if we consider the problem of overfitting in the Decsionn tree model, we can consider random forest classifier to be the next best model\n",
