# Employee-Attrition
Build a classification model for employee attrition using employees and their working performance dataset.

In this project I have tried to target the 2 main isuues faced by an HR departmetn of any Company.
  - Increasing retention - Using a tableau dashboard
  - Avoiding attrition - Using Python, Machine learning - classification model.

This project can be used for:
  1. Resume Filtering - Decreasing attrition by using it while resume filtering
  2. Promotions - Finding the loyal employees during promotions of higher/ manegerial posts
  3. Improve employee satisfaction - Detect the issues faced by employeees using tableau dashboards and solve them.
